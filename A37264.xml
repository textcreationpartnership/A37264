            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion I then gave. The Scope of that Sermon was to prove, That Christ upon the Cross did truly and properly bear, or sustain and represent the Persons of the Elect.

               </gap>ccording to the Divine Ordination, assumed our Nature into an Hypostatical Union, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nion, He assumed in that Nature, as a common Head, the Persons of the Election <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o an Union with Himself, as their Head, Root, Representative. This was then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ose. This Truth was then inferred from <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. as well as other Scripture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If the <hi>first,</hi> then it is plain the Scripture asserts it, and so several of the Reformers, and he himself also, whilest he is making opposition. What the Scriptures assert see in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10. In which words there are these Terms which ought to be Explained.</p>
            <p n="1">I. What is meant by the gathering together in one.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Word Imports a gathering of many scattered Sums into one Total Sum.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of divided Parcels of Histories and Arguments into one Summary.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of many Members into one Body, under one Head.</p>
            <p>And in general, comprehensive of these Three, to collect and joyn together several into one, even in the fullest Sense that I intend it for.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To wave what is said by others, I judge the whole Election is principally intended here.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because the Elect Number in Scripture are stiled Things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27,28. nay, all Things, (<gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the same Word with this in the Text) <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. But the Scripture hath concluded all under Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Elect Number is the Predicate here, concerning whom the Apostle treats, <hi>viz. Such as were chosen, predestinated, and made accepted from Eternity,</hi> ver. 4, 5, 6. The whole Scope of the Chapter is to speak of such in a limited Sense: Therefore such are those <hi>All Things</hi> mentioned in the Text, <hi>gathered together unto Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor does that overthrow this Exposition, what is here said, <hi>Things in Heaven, as well as things in Earth.</hi> For the Elect Number then gone to Heaven, though they were United to Christ afore, as the appointed Head of the Election; yet, when he Actually and Hypostatically United their Natures, He did therein Unite the Person of every Elect Vessel to Himself, in a more visible close manner, even in that United Nature; and of such also as were then gone to Heaven. For it pleased the Father to hang all the Glory of his House upon Him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 22.24. even the Vessels of great quantity (such as are perfected in Glory) as well as the Vessels of small quantity, <hi>viz.</hi> such as are imperfect Pilgrims here, and the meanest of them as well as the greatest.) And though they were gone to Glory, yet could not in this Sense be made Perfect without us, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.40.) <hi>viz.</hi> the Elect Number existing after his Incarnation.</p>
            <p n="3">III. What is meant by the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> In short, the time of our Lord's Incarnation. That is the meaning of that Scripture Phraseology. See <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>But when the Fulness of Time was come, GOD sent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law.</hi> The dubious Terms being Explained, I shall now raise these Observations from the Words poinent, to evince the Truth in question.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God, at a certain Time, collected and summed up the chosen ones into one Sum or Body, under one Head.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Center, in which they all met, or the Head, unto which they were recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, was CHRIST, <hi>That He might gather together in one, all things in Christ, — even in Him,</hi> again reiterated.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That this especial Time of gathering of them into One, was in the Fulness of Time, <hi>viz. When the Eternal Word was made Flesh.</hi> For that individual Nature as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42485:4"/> was a publick, common, representative One, and by means of that blessed One United thus Hypostatically, He brought into near Union to his own Person, the Persons of the chosen Ones, <hi>John</hi> 17.21,22,23. Whence 'tis evident, our nearness of Union to GOD is founded (as to the means) in this middle Chain, God assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Second Man into his own Personality, as a publick Head, that had a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>rmer than the Pillars of Heaven and Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> When God the Second Person took the Natures of the Election into a personal Union, He took their Persons also in that common Nature, into an Union to Himself, as the Root, Head, and Representative.</p>

I have already quoted one, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Rutherford,</hi> that infers what's tantamount from the same Scripture, in his Book of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> quoted by Dr. <hi>Chauncey,</hi> in his Book against Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> Page 223. Mark what he Writes, <hi>That Christ, and the Election, are not only one</hi> Natura &amp; Specie, <hi>but in Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood too, He assuming the Nature of Man,</hi> with a special Eye to <hi>Abraham,</hi> i. e. <hi>The Elect and Believers;</hi> proving it from this very place. And pray what is this less than I As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted? But suppose none ever had, yet still it is no Argument to me against the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. Do not we pray for, and expect great Light to break forth in the last Days; and that this Light will help the Saints to see further into the Word of God, than any other of his Servants since the Antichristian Apostacy? What offence should it be then, if the meanest of God's Servants should be taught from a particular Scripture, what others of his Servants have not been before? However, I shall lay down the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that moved me to expound the Words so, and leave them to the Censure of the discerning Christian.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The design of the Context is to set forth the Union between the Election and Christ, as their Head and Root. He positively asserts it in the eleventh Verse, and proves it in the subsequent Verses, by these Mediums. 1. That He owns them as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. 2. As Children (Expressions denoting great nearness of Relation.) 3. His living by Faith, as their Head and Exemplar; which Mediums are confirmed by the Authority of the Old Testament. See ver. 11. 12, 13. Next he argues it from the proximate Cause thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> His being made very Man; which he also proves, 1. From his Believing, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. 2. From the necessity of his being so, in order to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ends of Representativeship, ver. 14, 15. <hi>Forasmuch then as the Children were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Flesh and Blood, He also himself likewise took part of the same,</hi> &amp;c. This 16th. Verse seems to me again to repeat this Medium, and so draw the Conclusion, <hi>viz.</hi> And having assumed the nature of the Election, He is qualified to be an United Head and Representative to them. And this is further confirmed by the Subsequent Verse, That therefore He apparently is a suitable <hi>High-Priest,</hi> which is the same with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative. For that was one of the designments of the Priest under the Law, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the People, <hi>viz.</hi> to represent them in Sacrificing, and in the High-Priests entring into the Holy of Holies, with the Names of the Tribes Engraven upon his Breast-Plate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I argue the reality of this Inference from Remarks on the Words themselves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Word Nature is not in the Original, and there is no need of having it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. The Word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Governing a <hi>Genitive Case,</hi> as well as an <hi>Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> without altering the Sense; as is evident not only in Heathen Authors, but in the New Testament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.9. Implying there such an Apprehension, as signifies taking the Hand to himself, as the Word from the Etymology must needs, and does import Then the Sense will be, That He assumed not to himself Angels, but the Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis plain in Scripture Language, it signifies not only the Nature, but also the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb facs="tcp:42485:5"/> in that Nature into such an Union as may be between a Representative and thos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> represented by Him. These Premises duly weighed, it will follow, that the Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quence of the <hi>Prefacer's Argument</hi> is very illogical, and wrested greatly beyond th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Rules of Art and right Reason. He may as well argue, because the Second Perso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> took the nature of the Election into an Hypostatical, that therefore He took it into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Essential Union. And because He made it one Person with himself, therefore He Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it: As to argue, because He took the Persons of the Election into a Foederal Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that common Nature of theirs, He took them into Personal Union with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and so Christed them all. I bless God I abhor the Position as well as himself. Nor (though he does most unchristianly Insinuate it) can he by any solid Argument make it out, but by guessing at my meaning, which is like one of Mr. <hi>Williams Inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo's</hi> on Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Works. The Reason given why I must thus mean is, because it was not brought in under that Head of Christ's Representativeship. But with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, unless he can prove it was brought in under a Head, that laboured to prove that Christ assumed our Persons into an Hypostatick Union with himself, and so made Christs of them all, he does nothing. I appeal to his Conscience, whether any such thing was industriously laboured to be evinced in that Sermon. But further to clear it, That that, and no other could be my meaning, I must trouble the Reader again with a Rehearsal, <hi>viz.</hi> That the whole Scope of that Sermon was to Answer a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion delivered me in Writing, <hi>viz Whether Christ did truly and properly sustain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Persons of the Election on the Cross.</hi> It was affirmed as a glorious Truth. The chief Argument then used to prove it was this, That if Christ was the common Head, or Root, Surety and Representative of the Elect Number, then He Sustained their Persons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Scriptures of Truth did assert Christ to be the common Head, Root, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that two ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By Stiling our Lord so in express Terms, as to Head, Root and Surety.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By ascribing to Him, in reference to the Elect Ones, the highest and most pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Things, that the Notion of a Root or Head, Surety and Representative does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port amongst Men. And then I came to shew that the Foundation of such a Relation between Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t and Elect Persons, was laid in his assuming their Natures into a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Union with himself.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>er</hi> says, I brought it not in under that Head, wherein I shewed, That whatever is included in the Notion of a Representative amongst Men, is applied to Christ in the Scriptures. But what if not? And what if brought in under any of them, is it not the same? What if it was brought in under the Head of Christ's being held forth as a Root, and Surety, is it not the same import? and can he upon fair Construction screw my Meaning to a higher strain from thence? Dare he in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, the Searcher of Hearts say, That my meaning was to prove that all the Elect Number by this Union are Christed with Christ? If not, I would appeal to his Conscience, when it is nearest the Throne, Whether it be in him an act of unfeigned Brotherly Love, to insinuate this of me in Print to the World? And whether he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ould be so served himself? If I had delivered any thing ambiguous, it had been a Christian part in him to have discourss'd me about my meaning first.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> The Quotation from Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> is as trifling, as the imaginary Consequence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> am loaded with; Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> only denying (as I also do) that the Second Person <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>umed the Persons of the Election in an Hpyostatical Union with himself, as He did
<pb facs="tcp:42485:6"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#oxf" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ur Natures. But neither here, nor elsewhere denying, that in such an Assumption <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f the Nature of the Elect, as a common Nature, or common Head, Root, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e did also assume every individual Person of the Election into a Natural, Foederal, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd Legal Union with himself (as Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> Phrases it,) which is the Truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ween us under debate. Therefore it is as unfair to insinuate that Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> speaks <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gainst me, as 'tis to insinuate, I meant what I never did. Though the Authority of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> (whom I honour as a Learned and a good Man) if it were so, would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e but a meer Humane Authority.</p>
            <p>And hence an occasion is offered me to declare against the Practices of Writers in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hese Days who are Adversaries to the Truth; 1. That they hide their own Principles under an Ambiguous Form of Words. 2. They wrest the Positions of their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aries, and put them to the rack to speak what they would have them. 3. They quote <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome Sentences of Orthodox Men, that in a slighty reading may chime a little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Opinion, to patronize Assertions which they know they abhorred, and make the credulous People (whose Faith they know to be determined by great Names) believe such and such great Men were of that Judgment.</p>
            <p>If they would examine these Practices by the Rule of God's Word, they would find the first to be a Falshood, with an intent to deceive. The Second, a wrongful Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and Condemning the Innocent, by a tyrannick Force put upon their Words, with an intent to destroy them or their Reputations. The Third, a forcing good Men to be false Witnesses against their will and design; all which I reckon to be soul Immoralities, which must be accounted for to the Judge <hi>of quick and dead, at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing;</hi> being they are also refined, yet Malevolent Persecutions of the Glorious Gospel.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Prefacer</hi> has also hereupon took occasion to nibble at Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi>'s Book; but Mr. <hi>Ey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es</hi> stands in need of no great Defence from such an Assault: for his Arguments stand yet untouched for ought that can be perceived. Yet some few and slight Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions may be necessary for stating of Truth (if it may be) and put some end to Controversies and Clamours, if it be the will of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I judge it not necessary to speak both to Union and Justification, which the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facer</hi> has jumbled into one. Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi>'s Assertions (which are opposed) are in his Book about <hi>Justification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Though Mr. <hi>Eyres,</hi> and others, have Explained what they meant about <hi>Eternal Justification;</hi> and though this Explanation has not been disapproved of, nor judged by many unsound, yet a strife has been kept on foot under the shield of meer Words (that only have been rendred odious to the Vulgar, by a meer Noise and Clamour) for to uphold Parties in Religion, and make those (whom Christ does and will own as his Ministers) abhorred in their Names, Writing, and Preaching, of the generality of Professors and others.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Notwithstanding all these discouragements, I shall once more attempt to see how far Mr. <hi>Eyres,</hi> with others, and their Revilers, can be brought to an Agreement, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf" extent="1 span">

            <p>Thus have I told my meaning of <hi>Eternal Justification;</hi> if I am Erroneous, I desire this <hi>Prefacer,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> or any other, from God's Word, and in the Spirit of Meekness, to endeavour my Conviction. But if the <hi>Prefacer,</hi> and our Opposers, judge the Fault only to lie in the wording of it, then I say, why this Heat and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure meerly about Words? And especially, when they that affirmed, that these afore-mentioned Acts of God, may be properly enough stiled <hi>Justification,</hi> were Men of Eminent Parts, Godliness, Reading, Learning, and Skill in Polemical Divinity; such as <hi>Pemble, Twisse, Rutherford, Ames,</hi> besides Mr. <hi>Eyres,</hi> who are to this Day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted justly by the godly Learned, to be as Famous Men as <hi>England</hi> bred, and never taxed with <hi>Antinomianism,</hi> except by Mr. <hi>B—r,</hi> and his Admirers: And not only so, but when these also gave such Reasons for their Judgment, as I have not seen hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto Answered.</p>
            <p>I say, the <hi>Prefacer</hi> had done well to have seriously weighed Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi>'s Reasons, <hi>Page</hi> 89, 90, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why the Eternal Will of God not to Punish the Elect, should be called <hi>Actual Justification;</hi> and if he had not liked his Arguments, like a Christian, and a Disputant, from Scripture and found Reason, should have endeavoured to shew their weakness and absurdity. He should have considered, whether <hi>Justification</hi> be barely the declaring of a Sinner Righteous, or the Constituting also a Sinner, and making him Righteous; and given his Reasons, why 'tis only the former, and not the latter; and answer what is Alledged, for making or Constituting a Person Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That is <hi>Justification</hi> to which the definition of <hi>Justification</hi> does agree; but the Eternal Act of God's Will counting, and so Constituting the Elect Righteous in CHRIST's Righteousness, is according to the definition of Justification: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Proposition is an undeniable Maxim. The Assumption leans, <hi>first,</hi> on that Definition the Scripture gives of it. See <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.1,2. compar'd with <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6,8. as Explained by Mr. <hi>Eyres, Page</hi> 90. <hi>Secondly,</hi> on the usual Acceptation of it amongst Men. For Forgiveness amongst Men is principally an Act of the Heart; as when a Man purposeth in himself not to take Revenge, then he doth forgive. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Word <hi>Justifie</hi> doth signifie in its <hi>Etymology,</hi> and common acceptation in the Civil Law, to make one just, as well as to declare one just; and Sinners cannot be made Just, but by two ways: <hi>first,</hi> either Infusion; or, <hi>secondly,</hi> Imputation of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. The <hi>first</hi> we deny, as <hi>Popish</hi> and <hi>false:</hi> For, 1. None by Infusion are made perfectly Righteous here, so as to answer the demands of the Law. 2. Yet if so, it would not do, unless also Satisfaction was made to Justice for Violations of the Law,

But if by those Words are meant the Grant is conditional; then that is out of Doors also, since the Death and Obedience of the Lord Jesus, who performed all Conditions fully, unless it be for a new Law with milder Terms and Conditions: So that it appears by such Quibbling Distinctions, he more truely Fights with Shadows, than Mr. <hi>Eyres,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Twisse:</hi> And let me tell him, that Reflection upon Dr. <hi>Twisse,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Eyres,</hi> might have been better spared.

What then must that Censure be esteemed as dropping from the Pen of Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> and his <hi>Prefacer,</hi> Men whose Education is well known amongst their Neighbours; I fear no less than fulsom Vanity.

            <p>Thus far have I laboured to try how far we can agree in the <hi>Prefacer</hi>'s First Position, <hi>viz. That all the Chosen of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are decretively Justified from Eternity.</hi> I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now to the Second, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>That they are Vertually Justified at the Resurrection of Christ.</hi> And here I maintain;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God the Father's Act towards Christ then, was his actual Justifying of Him, as our common Head and Surety.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Christ, as our Surety in our room and stead, was actually Justified from all the Sins of the Chosen of God charged upon Him.

            <p n="3">3. That by this Act passed upon Christ, all his Spiritual Seed was actually Justified in Him, in respect of God's Act, and Christ's actual Justification in every Sense, as their Surety.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But yet they are not actually Justified with Christ, 'till their Believing; wherein they are made in some measure conformable unto the Resurrection of Christ: 'Till then they are not brought out of the Dungeon of a natural State; nor are the Fetters of Spiritual Death knocked off, 'till they receive, by Faith, that Justifying Act passed upon Christ into their own Consciences, whereby they are made to Rise with Him. And therefore, to be brief and plain, I thus word it:</p>
            <p>The Chosen Ones are actually Justified in Christ ever since his Resurrection; but Vertually only with Christ, 'till they Believe; and so Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> Explains it: The <hi>Prefacer</hi> knows best whether we agree herein.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The distinction is not right. 2. If so, it would not invalidate the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Distinction is not true: for according to the former Rules hinted about Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, the Members of the Distinction are not opposite; for the love of good will, (as Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> well proves) comprehends all in it, and therefore he chuses sometimes to call the latter the Love of Friendship, Commerce, or Communion. This Debate would be soon ended, if it was plainly stated, what is meant by this Love of Delight. By it must be meant, as far as I can judge,</p>
            <p n="1">1. God's Eternal Will to go forth by way of Union into the highest Creature-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. God's sight or vision from Eternity to Eternity, viewing the Persons of the Elect Number in Christ their Head compleat. Or,</p>
            <p n="3">3. God's accepting and delighting in the Approaches and Services of such Persons.</p>
            <p n="4">Or, 4. His manifesting himself to them, for to be enjoyed by them. Now therefore,</p>
            <p>If the <hi>first</hi> is intended, the Members of the Distinction are not lawfully opposite, the one being subordinate to the other, and included therein. For what is the Eternal Love of God towards a Person, but his Will to give all good to that Person he shall be capable of receiving? This is his Love of good Will. The principal Good he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to give, was Himself in our Natures, for Eternal Communion, this call (if ye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ill) his Complacency towards their Persons; so that in willing to give all good, he willed to give himself in Christ, to be Eternally enjoyed. So that here is no difference, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd therefore no ground for such a Distinction.</p>
            <p>It distinguishes between God's Will and Prescience, which Distinction is good in it self, but ill-applied to this Matter; for 'tis false and Non-sense, to limit his Prescience, (which is one Eternal View in Him, in which all things are from Eternity to Eternity, present to him, that he willed to be) to any time at all, but especially to limit them to the time of the Persons Believing. As if his glorious Knowledge of Vision never saw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Elect Sinner in his Son, afore the Sinner by Faith sees and apprehends it in his Conscience. But if,</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis granted the Distinction is true, it being between Love, as it is an Affection <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I am not soon persuaded to reject an old received Distinction or Expression, used by godly Men with a good intent; but when it is made use of to darken the Counsel of God, and becomes a Word without Knowledge; and when it is perverted to stumble the Weak, to confirm the Ignorant, to shelter Errors, and to darken Truth, 'tis time to reject it, especially this that is Anti-scriptural: The Scriptures of Truth affirm the contrary, <hi>viz. That God declares himself well pleased with Elect Sinners before they have Faith.</hi> It was the Sum of the Gospel the Angels Preached at the Incarnation of Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.14. <hi>Glory to God on the Highest, Peace on Earth, good Will towards Men.</hi> Good Will here is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, which is best rendred Well-pleasingness, Delight or Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency: And so the Word is rendred by the same Translators, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</hi> 'Tis the same Word here as in <hi>Luke,</hi> only here 'tis a <hi>Verb,</hi> and in <hi>Luke</hi> a <hi>Noun.</hi> Other places might be added, but let this plain Proof suffice to evidence, that 'tis an Un-truth against the very Letter of the Scripture, to say, <hi>That God loves not his Children afore Conversion, with a Love of Complacency,</hi> when the Angels at Christ's Incarnation, in their Heavenly Anthems, warbled it forth, and when the Father himself declared it towards our Head and Surety, at his Baptism, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. and Consummately at his Resurrection: And whatever he declared to his Son, as the Surety of the Election, the same, at the same time, he declared to the Election in him.</p>
            <p>Thus have I proved this Distinction, as commonly used, to be faulty; but yet if it were admitted, and take but along with it the Sense, wherein several that use it hold, Electing Love from Eternity towards the Persons of the chosen Ones, it would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ate the edge of the Argument in the least, <hi>viz.</hi> That whomsoever God loved with such a Love from Eternity in his own Breast, he could not possible hate, and be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto them; but 'tis true, (past all sober contradiction) Reconciliation on his part was in his blessed Mind to them from all Eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Second Branch of the Distinction is God's Act in declaring and manifesting his Reconciliation to them, which again is two-fold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Reconciliation declared to them in general, by their Surety, when he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly fulfilled all Covenant Conditions in their room and stead, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. <hi>ult.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.21.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When 'tis declared to, and revealed through the Organ of Faith to the Conscience of a Sinner, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8,9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11.</p>
            <p>All this may be fitly called <hi>Actual Reconciliation</hi> on God's part. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is in the Scriptures a Reconciliation said to be on our part. And here, pray observe, that the Scripture-Dialect bends most this way, to shew that God has Reconciled Sinners to himself, and not himself to Sinners, as might be manifested at large, if Brevi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y were not intended. But,</p>
            <p>This Distinction on our part may be also distinguished into that, that's Radical and Fundamental, <hi>viz.</hi> in our Root and Head, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. which consists in the actual Atonement we made in our Surety at his death. Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which on our part is actual in our Consciences, <hi>viz.</hi> When we are made by Grace to lay aside our Enmity in part against our blessed God and Father, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. To be sure this cannot be, 'till Faith is wrought in the Heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis evident that Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> means that which is on God's part actually declared at the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, even that actual Reconciliation obtained by the

            <p>The same Answer may suffice to what is Excepted against some Passages of his, in <hi>Pag.</hi> 46. <hi>That the Elect were thus freed, delivered, made compleat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in Christ their Surety and Representative, and Justified in that actual Justification He received for them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>What follows in the Preface, <hi>Page</hi> 6. to explain the Prefacer's meaning, I approve: And were it not for those odious Consequences he has insinuated to spring from Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi>'s Notions, (who has so accurately, solidly, and plainly delivered his Judgment about the timing of <hi>Justification</hi>) I should in that Explanatory Instance of his, have given him the right Hand of Fellowship, and so have ended the Debate.</p>
            <p>But the Absurdities he pretends to fix, savour not of a Christian Spirit, which moves me a little to review them. Our Notion of <hi>Eternal Justification</hi> at the time of Christ's Resurrection, and by Faith have been so plainly opened and stated, that to the godly Wise it would be a superfluous thing to vouchsafe a particular Examination of his wild Consequences; they can easily see they are all nothing to the purpose.

                  </gap>ion,</hi> and <hi>Justification in Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Justification,</hi> as being the <hi>thing willed,</hi> is two-fold:</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:42485:13"/>
            <p n="1">1. The same God Acting as one in Essence Decretively, in the same Act of Eternity, acting subsistentially, passes the Decree into a Covenant Transaction, between the Father and the Son, with the whole Election, his Seed considered in him: In which Covenant the Father Promised to the whole Election, <hi>John</hi> 1.2. by their Head set up from Everlasting, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22. Justification of Life. This Covenant Transaction is under some Considerations, the Effect of the Decree, and therefore the thing willed as it was in Eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The thing willed is in time, <hi>viz.</hi> An Act passed to the whole Election by Christ their <hi>Surety, Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>when raised from the dead,</hi> Rom. 6. <hi>ult.</hi> And this Act also terminated on their Consciences in Believing. Now there is a difference between God's Act of Willing in Eternity, and the first Effect of <hi>Sovereign Pleasure,</hi> viz. <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Transaction</hi> between the blessed Persons in Eternity. 1. The first being an Act of God considered as one in Essence. The 2d. an Act of God considered as Three, in the manner of subsisting, or Three Persons. 2. The one is a Decree, the other really a Covenant. 3. The former advances his Love and Soverainty, the latter, together therewith, his Faithfulness and Truth. 4. This Act under the former Consideration, sets up an everlasting Mediator; but under the latter Consideration supposes him as set up already; so that where there is such material ground for Distinguishing, there can be no confusion.</p>
            <p>Again, there is a difference between <hi>res volita</hi> in Eternity, even in the <hi>Eternal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact,</hi> and <hi>res volita</hi> in Time; even this Eternal Covenant promulgated divers ways, and at sundry times, but consummately in the publick, visible Transaction, between the Father and Jesus Christ (actually existing in our Natures in the fulness of Time) even from the Cradle to the Throne of the Majesty on High. 1. The one is an Act <hi>Secret,</hi> the other <hi>Revealed.</hi> 2. The one <hi>Eternal,</hi> the other <hi>Temporal;</hi> so that besides the Decree being Eternal, the thing decreed, in a sense, is proved to be Eternal, and differs from the manifestative Execution in Time. So that 'tis plain, the Assertion of <hi>Justification in the Eternal Compact,</hi> does not confound the Decree, and the Execution thereof. This Absurdity of the <hi>Prefacer</hi> seems to have most weight in it of all his six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, therefore I have repeated and urged anew, what Answers were cast in intersper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly afore. His</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second</hi> is — <hi>Then the Elect never fell in the first</hi> Adam, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis intended for an Hypothetick <hi>Syllogism;</hi> and thus it should run. If the Elect fell in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and there was a time when <hi>they were under the guilt of Sin,</hi> and were <hi>Children of Wrath,</hi> then they were not Actually Justified from Eternity; but the former is true, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter. To which I Answer:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Syllogism</hi> is false. For from affirming the Antecedent, it proceeds to den the Consequent. And in all <hi>Hypothetick Syllogisms</hi> that concludes Negatively; the Rule is, <hi>To advance from denying the Ant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cedent, to deny the Consequent, and the contrary theret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is faulty:</hi> so is this <hi>Syllogism</hi> of our <hi>Antagonists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Connexion</hi> is false; 'tis a meer <hi>non sequitur.</hi> It should have been a particu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lar Negative Branch of an Universal Negative; but 'tis not so. That which is un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstood by Justification from Eternity, is distinct from what is intended by Justifi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cation in Time. And so <hi>Non-Justification</hi> from Eternity is distinct from that whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is <hi>Non-Justification</hi> in Time. The former is Reprobation, the latter is God's Judicia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tence of Condemnation.</hi> And the former of both is not comprehended under the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42485:13"/> latter of both. But enough of this. 'Tis my Duty to make it plain to the Capacities <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f all God's Children, if the Spirit strikes in with it</p>
            <p>Let the <hi>Godly Reader</hi> know, That we hold not the Actual Existence of the Creature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rom Eternity; nor that the Election, as actually Existing, was actually guilty of the Breaches of a published Law; nor that the Blessed Mediator had, as existing in our Flesh, actually, publickly, and visibly performed Covenant Conditions for them; or that they had received an actual Discharge into their Consciences, for all these Tenents we abhor: But only, that God's Eternal Imputation of Righteousness to them, was an Act of God; therefore no need to load us with such direful Consequences. And unless they can prove these to be our Principles, their <hi>Consequences</hi> are to no purpose, but meer forged slanders cast upon Persons and Truths. I cannot but think they know in their Consciences we hold no such Principles; and how they will acquit themselves of throwing <hi>Calumnies</hi> upon the Truth and Us, will be known one Day. But to repeat again our <hi>Sentiments concerning Eternal Justification.</hi> It is an Act of God's Sovereign Pleasure, constituting Persons Righteous in the Righteousness of another, and Eternally Promising to the Lord Redeemer, a Discharge to them every manner of way, upon his Engagement to perform Covenant Conditions perfectly for them. Now let the Impartial Reader Judge, whether it can follow from these Principles, That the Elect must not fall in <hi>Adam?</hi> No, but the quite contrary; for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Sovereign Will, and Compact of God, that unalterably fixes the end, fixes all the Means conducing thereunto; and this is one of the principal Means, that they should of themselves lose their own personal Righteousness in <hi>Adam</hi> their Head, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> they might be alone compleatly Righteous in the Righteousness of a Redeemer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. So far as they are to be understood to have a Representative being in their ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Head, so far as considered in Him they were never otherwise than Rig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And this hinders not, but in that relation they had to <hi>Adam</hi> their Head, since the Fall, they are Guilty and Unrighteous: since Believers themselves, here, as in Christ have no <hi>Condemnation:</hi> As considered in themselves, or <hi>Adam</hi> their Root, have the <hi>Sentence of Death and Condemnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> His Third <hi>Consequence</hi> is this, <hi>viz. That Actual Justification is not, cannot be the Declaring, Pronouncing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The force of his Argument lies here, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Actual Justification</hi> is only the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring and Pronouncing <hi>an ungodly, guilty, and condemned Sinner,</hi> Just and Righteous through Christ's Righteousness: Therefore there cannot be in any Sense <hi>Actual Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>tion</hi> from <hi>Eternity.</hi> Whereunto I thus Reply:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is a <hi>Justification</hi> from <hi>Eternity,</hi> which he here grants.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But he would not have it Actual: If by Actual he means an Actual Discharge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the Conscience, and an Actual Conformity (in measure) to Christ's Resurrection, I am of his Mind. But if he means it in reference to God, the <hi>Sentence conceived in God's Mind,</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> says) <hi>from Eternity was Actual, it being an Act of God.</hi> And when we speak of Justification Analogously, 'tis generally understood of God's Act, and of that Act which the Scriptures call <hi>counting Sinners Righteous in the Righteousness <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f another,</hi> which is indeed an Act of his blessed Mind. And therefore I know not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hy Persons should be offended at the Word <hi>Actual Justification from Eternity.</hi> For if there was any Justification at all from Eternity, it was only God's Act in his own Breast, and therefore could not be any thing but Actual.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:42485:14"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> His Fourth <hi>Consequence</hi> is, <hi>That by this Notion the Elect are twice Justified,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And it makes a posterior and collateral Act in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It runs thus: There is no posterior or collateral Act in God, therefore there can be no Actual Justification from Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. What we mean by <hi>Actual,</hi> has been already Explained. 2. But I know not what he means precisely, (1.) by Posterior or Collateral Acts: And (2.) by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them both together in his Argument. 3. We make Justification, as it is an Act in God, to be one continued unchangeable Act from Eternity, which appears to be a plain Consequence from our Positions. 'Tis this very thing makes us contend for Justification from Eternity, because Justification really is fundamentally an Act of God's Mind, and all Acts of his Mind are Eternal and Unchangeable. The blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Inferences of Acts arising <hi>de novo</hi> in God's Mind, towards <hi>Elect Sinners,</hi> we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to Fence against, by Asserting <hi>Eternal Justification.</hi> And the Position, as we hold it, effectually destroys them; and yet must the Principle be accused of countenancing and indulging those horrid things 'tis directly shaped to oppose and quash?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Justification</hi> from Eternity, and <hi>Justification</hi> at the Resurrection of Christ, differ but as God's Secret and Revealed Will does; and there is no other Distinction between them. God's Secret and Revealed Will are not two Acts in God; his Revealed Will is but the Declaration of the Acts of his Mind; and that Act is but one and the same with the Act of his Mind: <hi>An Acquittance in the Heart of the Creditor, and in a Paper. A Pardon in the Heart of a Prince, and Enrolled</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> well says) <hi>is one and the same; this Manifested, and the other Secret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5, <hi>Justification pronounced</hi> may be at sundry times, and in divers manners, and yet but one and the same Act. And as Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> adds, <hi>Page</hi> 105. Though there are never so many Copies written forth in several Hands, they do not make many Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, or many Pardons, being but the Transcripts of one Original. And though God's Love in his Breast, and this Love as testified divers ways and times, both in Old and New Testament, multiplies not Acts of Love in God, but is one and the same Act of Love in Him. The same may be said of Justification as it is an Act of God's Secret Will, and as it is an Act of his Revealed Will, and as Revealed at various Seasons, and in variety of ways. Good Men, counted Sound, Pious, Learned and Intelligent, have differed among themselves in ascribing Justification to several Periods, yet for the most part Judged not one another <hi>Antinomian:</hi> Nor this Inference just and lawful from thence, <hi>viz. There are posterior Acts in God. Alsted, Pemble, Twisse, Rutherford, Ames, Eyres, Crandon,</hi> &amp;c. Judged that God's Eternal Act, <hi>viz. Actus volendi,</hi> might properly enough be termed Justification, and yet denied not all the various Acts of his Revealed Will.</p>
            <p>The rest, that limits Justification to an Act of his Revealed Will, yet have vastly differed as to the Timing of it: <hi>Macovius</hi> judges it to be then, when the first Promise of Grace was given forth to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> though he says we are Virtually Justified in Christ, in respect of our Consciences, yet he asserts, That Christ as the Sinners Surety, took out at his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, a real, actual, formal Discharge, in his own Name, and the Name of the whole Election; which is that great Original Discharge they receive into their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in Believing. According to him 'tis in Christ actually as a Root; and it follows, if the Life of a Tree be actually in the Root, that Tree may properly enough be said

I further prove from the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Expressions that define Faith, that 'tis Instrumental to the Conscience-Knowledge of Justification, as it is it's Object. (1.) Conscience-Justification is opposed to the Conscience-Knowledge of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20, &amp;c. And thus I argue Conscience-Justification; which is by Faith opposite to the Conscience-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, which is by the Law. Conscience-Condemnation, which is by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin; or the practical Conscience-Knowledge in a Man, that he is sinful, guilty and unrighteousness, as in the first <hi>Adam</hi> and under the first Covenant. Therefore on the contrary, that Conscience-Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is a Knowledge in the Conscience of imputed Righteousness, and it's being counted righteous and discharged therein. 'Tis the Apostles own Syllogism, as in the fore-mentioned Place, as the godly Learned may easily perceive. (2.) 'Tis set fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

And I wonder the <hi>Prefacer</hi> would take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Mr. <hi>Eyres</hi> Explanation and Arguments in that Point.</p>
            <p n="2">2. My second Answer is; that suppose this was such an Heresie; yet how does it follow from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Justification in the Sense afore explained? 'Tis enough for me to say, I deny his Consequence, and require him to make it good: But that has been the least of his Care, to evince his Consequences to be lawful and genuine. Yet I would feign know of him, how does this accursed Principle follow more from our Tenent of Eternal Justification, than from what he and others hold with us? <hi>viz.</hi> That God actually loved his chosen ones from Eternity; actually Elected and predestinated them: Since Eternal Justification in our Sense, is a Branch thereof thus diversified from that Respect it has precisely to some Part of the Means predestinated in Order to the end, as afore mentioned?</p>
            <p n="3">3. I Answer, (1.) Though a Notional Faith floating only in the Head, changes not the State nor Course of Life; but may give Encouragement to Drunkards and Whore-Masters through the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Lust to continue in their Wicked Courses (as some of Old would <hi>continue in Sin, that Grace might abound,</hi> Rom. 6.1. And <hi>turned the Grace of God into Lasciviousness,</hi> Jude) Yet that Faith that is of the saving Operation of the Spirit, <hi>Purifies the Heart and Walk,</hi> Acts 15.9. <hi>ch.</hi> 16.28. 1 Pet. 1.22. <hi>Obeying the Truth</hi> in this Place, is by a Periphrasis put for Faith. Hence 'tis frequently stiled in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a Holy Faith. And to prove this Truth from each of it's Particulars; (1.) 'Tis plain from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that all Parts of Holiness is carried on by Faith in Exercise. Thus Mortification of Sin is in all it's Parts. As (1.) Saving Conviction of Sin, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.5. The Spirit as a Comforter, savingly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Sin, and that by convincing the Soul of Judgment and Righteousness, <hi>John</hi> 16.7. the 12th, (2.) Saving Compunction and Sorrow for Sin, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. (3.) True and Evangelical loathing of Self and Sin. This made <hi>Isaiah</hi> cry out of his <hi>Vileness,</hi> Isa. 6.5. Made Holy <hi>Job</hi> after all (though <hi>Perfect</hi> and <hi>upright</hi> Man) abhor and repent himself in <hi>Dust and Ashes,</hi> Job 42.5,6. See further <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. ver. 53. and 54. compared, ver. 60. and 61. compared, ver. 62. and 63. compared. Also <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. ver. 24. to 31. compared with 31. and 32. (4.) Right Confession of Sin, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. ver. 20, 21. (5.) Forsaking of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2,3,4, &amp;c. 11, 12, 13, 14. with many other Places.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As Mortification of Sin in all its Parts, is carried on by Faith, laying hold and applying to it self the Grace of Christ. So Faith <hi>receiving</hi> sensibly into the Conscience superabounding Grace in Christ, and the Righteousness of Jesus as a free Gift, causes that Soul to reign in spiritual Life by <hi>one</hi> Christ Jes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. And thus Faith in exercise, carries on positive Holiness in all its Branches, this the wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>le Man in Thought, Word, and Deed. In Thought: As</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:42485:17"/>
            <p n="1">(1.) A Heavenly Conversation, compare <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. with <hi>ver.</hi> 8, to the 15. which further appears in considering, that this Heavenly Conversation is an Holy Fellowship maintained with the Father and the Son, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. compar'd with it, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. This will be clearer yet; if we view how this Holy Communion in all its particulars must be carried on by Faith in is exercise. (1.) As 'tis the Souls ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to God, <hi>He that cometh to God must believe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. (2.) As 'tis a coming to God as a reconciled God and Father through the appointed way Christ, his Purity, Obedience and Blood, <hi>John</hi> 10.9. chap 14.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10,19,20, &amp;c. There is no coming to God, but through Christ; <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. Nor no coming to Christ not by Christ, but through Faith; <hi>John</hi> 13.1. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.21. Repentance <hi>or returning towards God is by Faith in the Lord Jesus.</hi> (3.) As 'tis a viewing, and admiring his boundless Eternal Love and Grace manifested in the Son of his Love, and together therewith the Love of the Redeemer in our Natures; 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.16. To dwell in God, and to have God dwell in the Soul, is to have Communion with him. But says the Holy Ghost here, To <hi>dwell in God,</hi> &amp;c, is <hi>to know and believe the love, that he has to us.</hi> (4.) As 'tis a Prostration of the Soul and Conscience at the Throne and Foot-stool of this free Love, it cannot be managed, but in a way of Believing. Thus the Prodigal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. believing he was his Father, still bowed down afore him. (5) As it makes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ming Love again. No Soul can Love God, till he first believes God's Love through Christ to his own Soul, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As a Heavenly Trade and Conversation, consists in an inward Soul Exercise of the Grace and Fruits of the Spirit, 'tis also carried on by Faith. For (1.) 'Tis Faith that brings Supplies of Influences from the Fulness of Christ, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. 'Tis Faith going to God in the fulness of Christ for Assistance, that in the very direct Act draws Water of Life out of the same fulness for Assistance, <hi>John</hi> 15.4,5. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>om.</hi> 5.17. (2.) 'Tis the same Faith continued in Act, that prepares, disposes and excites this recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Seed into exercise diversified according to the Object. Thus Faith as it views the beloved Object goes forth and works in Love towards it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. 'Tis said <hi>to Work by Love.</hi> Faith acting into the fulness of Christ, empties the Soul of self, and so works by true Humil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty and Self-denial; and so of the rest, Hope, Patience, Joy, Meekness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (3.) Faith promotes these Graces into outward Fruits of Holiness.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) As a Heavenly Conversation, consists otherwise in diversity of Holy Thoughts and Meditations, concerning God and Christ, his Kingdom, Glory, Ways, Commands, Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are all exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, promoted and directed by a lively Faith. Because no Thoughts of God are right, but of God in Christ; nor any Thoughts of Christ truly spiritual, but what spring from Faith. They that would exercise Thoughts, as Persons risen with Christ, must exercise them in Believing. They whose Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, would seek things above, must seek them above where Christ is, <hi>viz.</hi> at God's Right Hand, and 'tis Faith alone can seek them there, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1,2,3. Thus have I proved from the Scriptures of Truth, that Faith carries on the great Work of Heart-holiness.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Faith in like manner promotes Holiness of Lip. And what is that, but confessing <hi>with the Mouth, what we believe with the Heart,</hi> Rom. 10.10. So, 'tis undeniably true, that Holy Profession as 'tis a Lip labour, consists in professing with the Mouth, what we believe with the Heart concerning God and Christ, and their things, and our Interest in them, and concerning our selves; what we are in our Selves, and what we are in our Head, and the Relation we stand in to God as our Father, and this in Prayer, Praise, and Conference, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All our Speech that <hi>Minister's Grace to the Hearers,</hi> Eph. 4.29. ought to be in the round of our Holy Profession. And this Holy Profession, cannot be maintained without Faith, and Faith in exercise. We must hold fast our Faith, if we hold fast the Profession of our Faith. We must not only know but believe, or our afore-mentioned Profession will be vile Hypocrisie, and not the Holy Language of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Thus also this Truth is confirmed, that Holiness of Tongue must flow from lively Faith in Exercise. And</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) No less does Faith manage Holiness of Life. When the Apostle urges <hi>Timothy</hi> to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of divers Holy Duties; he directs him how, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. <hi>My Son be strong in the Grace, that is in Christ Jesus.</hi> And there is no being strong therein, but by a strong and firm Conscience-persuasion thereof. 'Tis putting on the Lord Jesus by Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> believing on him as our Head and Surety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroies all base Designs in the Soul for Self and Sin. This obstructs <hi>making Provision for the Flesh to fulfil the Lusts thereof,</hi> Rom. 13.14. A Holy Conscience-persuasion of the spiritual Priviledges we have in Christ will make us <hi>careful to maintain good Works,</hi> Tit. 3 8. in the way of Believing. The Grace of God as received by true Faith to reign in the Conscience, <hi>teaches to deny ungodliness and worldly Lusts, and to live righteously, soberly and godly in this present World,</hi> Tit. 2.11,12. All outward Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances towards God, are Acts of Worship and Religious Service. They must be done in Faith as <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>el</hi>'s was, or they will not be accepted; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3,6. For <hi>without Faith 'tis impossible to please him.</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:42485:18"/> All Worship, if True and Evangelical must be in <hi>Spirit and in Truth,</hi> John 4.23. (1.) As of old the Worship was typically true, if in the Place divinely appointed; if offered in the appointed Garments, and on the Consecrated Altar: So now the Worship is substantially true, if our Gifts be offered in the Temple opened in Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> the Person of Christ manifested there: And the Worshippers by Faith put on the Priestly Garments of Christ's Righteousness, and offer their Gifts on that Altar, the Purity of his Nature advance to an infinite value by the Grace of Union: And without this the Worship can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true. Yea all outward Acts thereof; if they flow not from these inward Holy Acts, though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally according to Rule; yet 'tis but false Worships in God's account. Now thus to offer, as has been mentioned, requires not only Faith, but strong Faith. (2.) Evangelical Worship must be in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit too: And where the Spirit assists to the performance, he does it as a Spirit of Adoption; <hi>witnessing with our Spirits that we are the Children of God, and teaching us to cry Abba Father,</hi> Rom. 8.15,16. If we are led by the Spirit of God in our Worship, we Act as Sons of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. We Pray as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to a Father, we Praise him as our Father; we hear him in the Ministry of the Gospel as a Father, and we do all to him as a Father: And all this cannot be done without Faith in Exercise. (3.) All Acts of Worship are Testimonies of Love to him, or they are not Right; and we cannot testifie Love to him, without we Love him, nor can we Love him, unless we believe on him. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. All Duties of Temperance and Sobriety towards our Selves, of Justice and Mercy towards our Neighbour, are but wretched Legality, and painted Hypocrisie, unless done in Faith. 'Tis a Rule universally extensive the Holy Ghost gives us: <hi>Whatsoever is not of Faith is Sin,</hi> Rom. 14.23.</p>
            <p>All Duties, if not performed in Love want the Life and Soul of Holiness: And it must be Love to God as our Father, and to Christ as our Husband. It has been proved, there can be no such Love in our Hearts, but what is wrought from a Sense of our Father's Love unto us; and this Sense of his Love is acquired only by Faith. Thus I have proved by Particulars, that Holiness of Heart and Life is produced by a lively Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Observe, Reader, that without such a Faith, there can be no Evangelical Holiness (and that's only Right) but what flows from Gospel Principles, urged by Gospel Motives, done by Gospel Means and performed for Gospel Ends. Now I will make it appear, that none of these can be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith in Exercise.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Principles must be Infused Light, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. Life, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6. and Love, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. (these being the <hi>Principia quibus.</hi>) Now the two first of these, in their first flowing in form Faith, and their influx is continued by the Exercise of Faith; which is that <hi>Bucket,</hi> that <hi>draws Water out of the Wells of Salvation.</hi> The Third is always the Effect of sensible Faith: And Faith is that great Channel or Conduit-pipe, through which they are conveyed to the Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Motives are from the free Love and Grace of God manifested in the Person, and undertakings of Christ Jesus. All which must be apprehended by Faith: For Faith alone apprehends the Record, that God gives of his Son, and of that Eternal Life in and by him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10,11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Means by which Holy Graces are exercised, and Works of Holiness done, is by vertue of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the Person of Christ; and this I grant, and affirm, that this Union is not influential, or at least sensibly influential, if not apprehended by Faith. In him we must spiritually Live, Move and Act. All our spiritual Actings must be as Members of him, and by virtue of Implantation into him; <hi>John</hi> 15.4,5. As my Finger moves every time in the Life of my Body, and in the Face of the Spirits, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side in the Head: So the Members of the Lord Christ, when they move and act aright, move and act in the Life and Fulness that's their Head: And Faith is the alone Instrument of this influential Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plantation, and of all spiritual actings in the vertue thereof. The <hi>principium quod</hi> of our spiritual act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the fulness of Grace in our Head, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. That's the Fountain, that sends down continual Rivulets into the Soul. And Faith is the ground-way of Conveyance: So that a Soul cannot perform what is good by the right Means thereof, but in Faith.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The End of our Good Works, should not be to purchase, procure, or obtain any of his Favours: But for the Praise of the Glory of his free Grace, and to the Honour of him; <hi>Who hath called us out of Darkness to his marvellous Light,</hi> Eph. 1.6. 1 Pet. 2.9. Now 'tis impossible for any Soul to have these right aims and ends in good Works without Faith in exercise; which I thus prove. Either a Soul must Act for to gain spiritual Life, or from that Life already received; there can be no third. The former he cannot, because the Hypothesis supposes him without Life, and therefore unable to stir or move; consequently it must be the latter, <hi>i. e.</hi> from Life received. And where-ever there is Life received, it supposes Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Service must be either servile or filial, either for wages, or because of an Inheritance given
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42485:18"/> and sure. The former is not true Service, for 'tis against the Current of Scripture, and Nature of Evangelical Holiness; therefore the latter is. And it follows, he that serves as a Son has received the Charter or Grant of Adoption which is received by Faith, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. And the Spirit of Adoption, which is consequential of Believing, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the End of Holy Duties be to the Praise of free Grace, and to the Honour of a Father and Husband; then this infallibly supposes Faith in the Subject that has already received Grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6. And that does practically know and acknowledge God to be his Father, and Christ to be his Husband. Then upon the whole; if without Faith, and Faith in Exercise; there can be no Right, Principle, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, Mean, or End of good Works (and consequently without these or either of these, the most splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Works for outward shew cannot be Holy.) <hi>Then</hi> Faith is <hi>not the Way to licentiousness.</hi> But it has been proved without Faith in Exercise, there can be no true Holiness: This Truth the first Reformers earnestly contended for, and the Homilies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> excellently set forth; and (I am most confident) is the <hi>Prefacer</hi>'s Judgment; then why such a scurvy Reflection on Faith, whereas I am satisfied, he knows in his Conscience, 'tis not a Notional and Hypocritical Faith, we mean or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for. Though we say, Faith in the proper Sense, justifies in the Conscience only declaratively; yet we affirm, that in so doing it has other great uses; the greatest whereof is to produce Holiness of Conversation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Observe, as Faith, and that as 'tis justifying, purifies the Conscience; nay the whole Man and his Conversation. So 'tis Faith, as it evidences to the Soul it's free Justification in Christ, and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

            <p>More might be added, but these are sufficient to prove; that Faith as evidently declaring Pardon in the Conscience, does not only include the change of the State, but has the highest tendency to mortifie Sin, and quicken to Righteousness; nay, that without Holiness cannot be carried on, as it should be: So far is <hi>Faith, as it justifies in the Conscience, declaratively, from confirming Persons in their wickedness.</hi> To all which I add a</p>
            <p n="4">4. Consideration <hi>(viz.)</hi> That such a Faith as this changes the Estate, and begins as well as carries on Holiness of Life; which I thus evince, premising some Considerations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Soul, is wholly Passive in God's first saving Work upon it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That God in this first saving Work infuses a supernatural Principle of Divine Light and Life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That this infused living Light is subservient to a true Conscience-Arraignment, as well as Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence-Justification. Hereby the Soul at the same time comes to see and feel, 'tis without Righteousness Strength, and a discharge in it self considered in the first <hi>Adam;</hi> but at the same time is assured, there is Justification, Righteousness, and Strength freely for condemned, vile, impotent Sinners in the second <hi>Adam,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.24.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That by this saving discovery, that there is such a Remedy freely provided in another; as well as the prevalency of the Disease in ones self, the Soul is kept from sinking under Despair, under such a Conscience-Condemnation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That this sight of the Remedy in respect of influences, admits of Degrees, sometimes it only keeps the Soul from quite Despairing; but Guilt and Conviction of Sin lies uppermost in the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Sometimes the Soul is kept in an indifferent poize between Hope and Fear.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That that keeps the Soul in Hope is, that at the first Manifestation of the Object under Sense of Condemnation, the Soul secretly leans on Christ and his Righteousness; whence the Distinction of the two fold acting of Faith on Christ. (1.) That which is more secret and insensible. (2.) That, that is more sensible and perceiveable.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That this secret leaning on Christ discovers it self in an approbation of this Way of Salvation in willing and desiring to have an Interest in this Righteousness, and to draw nigh to God therein; and a great Sense of the absolute need thereof.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That Proportionable to these Efforts of a secret leaning on this Righteousness, there is Joy and Holiness in the Seed thereof; but not in the real lively and apparent Fruits.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That justifying Faith as the Scripture urges, it is such an Application to the Soul, as sensibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves Guilt and Condemnation from the Conscience. And therefore is a more sensible Act of Faith, than what was afore described. 'Tis the Souls receiving Christ and his Righteousness as it's own, and and God's justifying Act through Christ to himself.</p>
            <p n="10">10. That though the Estate be initially, yet not consummately changed; till such an Act is put forth, that believes this Righteousness as it's own, leans on it as it's own; goes to God in it as it's own, and pleads it for acceptance, and welcome as it's own. These things considered, I roundly assert, that, that Faith that consummately changes the State is that, that is more or less sensible or assuring, and in a proper Sense justifies in the Conscience declaratively. I prove it thus</p>
            <p n="1">1. If Faith in a proper Sense justifies in the Conscience no way; but Declaratively then it follows the first justifying Faith has more or less of this Conscience-assurance in it. But the former is true (as has been already proved) and therefore the latter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Faith the Scripture requires of such as see their need of Christ, is this sensible Acting of Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14. (1.)

            <p n="3">3. It appears, the Scripture requires of the Sinner such Faith at first for his Justification. Because it requires such an Act of Faith, as removes sensible Guilt from the Conscience, that the Soul might serve the living God; <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.71,74. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 77, 78, 79.</p>

And if then such Confidence must be expressed; when Faith is stript of all its crutches, it undeniably infers, that in the Nature of Faith there is Holy Assurance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As has been alledged afore, there is the afore-specified Assurance in every scriptural Expression; that sets forth Faith. A Soul made truly sensible of its own guilt, and the wrath that Sin deserves: Of its own Vileness, impotency and incapacity to satisfie the Justice and Law of God, cannot be put off with an Assurance there is a Remedy for others; if he has not a dram of Assurance that it is for him. A Soul thus awakened, will not trifle with a general view of a compleat Righteousness in Christ; but be serious in the Matter; and take no Rest, nor find any Peace, without believing 'tis for him. A Conscience loaded with the Sense of guilt, will not be disburthened without some Assuranc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

In a fiducial Recumbency, as an Act of the Will, there is a confident Leaning on Christ's Righteousnss as that, that does indeed give acceptance.

Let Divines define particular Application, by what Metaphysical Terms they please; the honest plain Christian will take it for no less, than a believing Christ and his Righteousness is his; that Christ hath satisfied for him, and that God hath pardoned and justified him in Christ his Surety. From all the foregoing, I conclude Conscience-assurance is of the very Essence of saving Faith; even in the Sense it has been explained. But they that would see this more fully proved, may peruse Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi>'s excellent Treatise of Sanctification; particularly from <hi>Page</hi> 168, to 193. But</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>
               <hi>Answer</hi> 3. I deny his Consequence, <hi>viz.</hi> That the accused Definition of Faith, has a tendency to discourage the Saints; whom says he, may have true Faith, though they do not know it. The Thing I grant is true, they may have so. But that they know it not, 'tis for want of better Instruction; and they may thank such, who by their Ministry,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Keep them in Ignorance, and will not instruct them. (1.) What must be the ground of their Faith and Conscience-persuasion, <hi>viz.</hi> Not Qualifications, Marks, or Signs, in themselves; but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite fulness of the Grace that is in Christ for Sinners so suited to their needs, and the infinite freeness thereof, as tendered and held forth in free, absolute, unconditional Promises. And the Authority of God, who commands Sinners as Sinners, in the Sense of their absolute need of Christ and his Righteousness; to take him as their own, and venture on him as such: Not from any Motives whatever in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but from Motives fetched from the Object, and the faithfulness of the Promiser, and in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his great Command of Believing. (2.) In the Nature of their own acting, of Faith, which they would hide from themselves; and shew them, that in what they Experience in themselves of the lowest acts of true Faith, there is real assurance of the Object in Relation to themselves. That in their looking to Christ with pleasedness and support, they do really look to him as their own; or their throughly awakened Consciences could have no Ease nor Peace, with bare looking to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Perswasion of their Interest; or that in their coming to Christ, their Consciences come to him indeed, as the way to the Father. And that in Leaning on him and his Righteousness, their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are in some Measure persuaded, that they are in him and his Righteousness, and as in him justified and accepted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (3.) That they do not instruct them, that 'tis their Duty to know their own Acts, and to bring them forth to act before the Conscience, with as much clearness and plainness as possible; and that 'tis their Duty to charge their Consciences to speak out plainly, and without stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nering. If Leaning on Christ for acceptance, be the same with a practical Persuasion, that God does accept me in Christ; and that it is the same with this. I am now justified and accepted in Christ. The last is the most plain, and effectual for Consolation, and Holiness: Why are not the Consciences of the Saints directed and charged to speak on, till they speak out very plain; so that they may be understood by themselves and others. Conscience in the Language of Faith, should not only say, in the Lord there is Righteousness and Strength for Sinners; and I have some little uncertain hope it is for me. But it should boldly say, In the Lord have I Righteousness and Strength. And not rest there, but go on and say, in the Lord above, such a Vile Sinner, as I, am compleatly Righteous: Such an impotent Sinner, as I, am very Strong. Poor Souls should be persuaded to urge every direct act of Faith, into a reflex act of Faith, and not only lay hold on what is in Christ for them; but be assured, that they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>so are in Christ for them; and not only so; but what they are in Christ. Even their Person and Duties too: How fair! How accepted! 'Tis Faith drove up to this Head, that will b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. They may thank them, who keep them in Ignorance, by terrifying them also from this Holy, Practical, Conscience-Perswasion, with Bug-bear Names and false Insinuations. This Holy Assurance is called now a-days Antinomianism, Fancy, Delusion, and rendred Suspicious of feeding Souls with false Hopes, and teaching Licentiousness, till they are drowned in Perdition; whence poor Souls are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:42485:22"/> and doubtful they are about their State; the more it will put them on Working. And so indeed sometimes it will. But what sort of Works will they be? No other than first Covenant-Works for Life. <hi>Dead Works</hi> that must be <hi>purged off the Conscience by the Blood of the Lamb;</hi> if ever they would <hi>serve the Livirg God</hi> aright, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Dead</hi> and <hi>unprofitable Works;</hi> that <hi>they need a Repentance from, Heb.</hi> 6.1.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They may thank them for laying afore their Consciences, such a Doctrine of Assurance as is False, Impracticable, Uncertain, and Corrupting.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis False. For (1.) The true Assurance has Christ and his Fulness, that is above for it's Object. Their Assurance has partly Christ, and partly inward Qualification. (2.) Scriptural Faith of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is founded upon the Truth of free Promises. This of theirs upon conditional ones. 'Tis Grace infinitely Free, that true Faith is encouraged from, and does embrace; but that sort of Assurance, embraces only conditional Grace; and is encouraged from supposed Conditions found out in a legal Walk. The formal Reason of true Assurance of Faith, is Obedience to the Command, But of this, is a Conscience claim upon performance of Conditions. So the Assurance commended to poor Souls, has nothing of the Nature of Faith in it: For the Nature of Faith is to receive Grace as freely offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. So consequently 'tis false.</p>
            <p n="2">2, 'Tis Impracticable, as 'tis defined. 'Tis setting up Qualifications, to judge of the Truth of Faith by, in their Light; whereas the Light of Faith must judge of them, whether they are right or no. If no Qualifications be right, but what flows from Faith in immediate Exercise; I must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily know first, I then truly believe; before I can tell, that such Qualifications are the real product of my exercised Faith.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis Uncertain. For (1.) Though a <hi>Pharisee</hi> may soon arrive at Comfort thereby: Yet where there is the least spark of true Grace, they may be very long ere they come at the least drop of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation: And (2.) 'Tis soon lost. And (3.) At best 'tis but very dark. Were not Souls willing to be flattered into false Hopes, they could have no stable Joy from it. The true Assurance may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at first, and continued under Desertion. Says <hi>Calvin, Nisi fidem tremere &amp; vacillare volumus,</hi> &amp;c. Unless we will have our Faith be trembling and wavering. 'Tis necessary we found it on the free Promises of Grace in Christ.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis Corrupting. It does not truly purifie Heart, Lip, nor Life. The Joys and Comforts, that flow from it make the Soul but the worse: Whereas true Assurance of Faith purifies all; as has been proved. That sort of Assurance, has a tendency to neglect Spiritual Communion and Holy Walking. It does not awe sin and quicken to Holiness, by abiding in the presence of the Father and the Son. It does not derive supplies of Influences from the Foutain. It does not exert the Graces and Influences of the Spirit; Souls embracing this Cloud, instead of true Faith are prone to fall into spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Security. If they come hereby to a Presumption, that they have escaped Hell-fire, and are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for Heaven, they can indulge themselves in a persuit after the World, Self-seeking and Sin; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that they can keep their Consciences quiet, and keep up their quiet, and keep up their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among other Professors. Hence it appears, that all Comforts fetch't from an Assurance built on Marks and Signs, make the Soul rather worse than better. And has a tendency to Licentiousness. Therefore how dangerous is it to take away from Souls the right Assurance of Faith, and gave them this instead of it, that is not true; but is impracticable, uncertain, and Soul-defiling. Now let the Godly Reader judge; which Definition of the Assurance of Faith, is the Helper of the Saint's Faith and Joy, and which the Destroyer? So that the Consequence fixed on us, returns on his own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
            <p>His Seventh <hi>Argument is, That 'tis directly contrary to the express Word of God.</hi> I Answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis not true, I challenge him and all to produce one Scripture, through the whole Book of God, that contradicts, that that Sentence conceived in God's mind from Eternity, towards elect Sinners pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced unto them on Christ their Head; when he arose from the Dead is no Justification. The Place he alledges does not. For (1.) There is a Condemnation, which is the same with suffering the Vengeance of Eternal Fire; from which they are fundamentally secured by God's Eternal Will not to punish them. (2.) There is a Condemnation at the publick Tribunal of Justice in his promulgated Word: And that again is twofold. (1.) Condemnation of all, that fell in <hi>Adam</hi> in general, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.16. As they were <hi>Adam</hi>'s Race, unless Covenant Conditions be performed by them, or by one for them, and publick, compleat Satisfaction be given to Law and Justice. Now from this, the Elect number, <hi>Quatenus</hi> Elect, and Christ's Seed were fully delivered; when Christ died and rose again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33,34. (2.) A Condemnation of their Estate, or of them in reference to their State. Justice on the Throne of the
<pb facs="tcp:42485:22"/> Published Word pronounces, <hi>That as many as are of the Works of the Law are under a Curse,</hi> i. e. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> whole Man is defiled, and whatever they do is accursed: Their State is a cursed State: Because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a State of doing for Life. Justice on that Throne requires a twofold bringing in, and pleading o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Satisfaction. <hi>First,</hi> That Satisfaction be pleaded by their Surety; which was done, when he entred to Heaven: And had a Discharge put into his Hand for his whole Seed: But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Justice requires that Conscience bring it, and plead it, e're Conscience has the Discharge put into its Hand; or else it holds him fast in reference to his State and Conscience. And this brings me to the Third Sort of Condemnation, which is a Conscience Condemnation, <hi>viz.</hi> In the two Latter Sences, the Elect Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner lies under Condemnation: In reference to his State, as considered in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and on the first Covenant; and as he stands at the Bar of his Conscience. But not in reference to Condemnation simply taken. But the <hi>Prefacer</hi> would have the Sinner freed at the Bar of his Conscience; (1.) Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Conscience does not always feelingly condemn and hurry to Despair. (2.) Because a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in a natural State, cannot condemn of the Sin of Unbelief. To both which I oppose these things. 1. 'Tis his mistake to think there is no Conscience Condemnation; but where there is felt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair. Security and hardness of Heart, and Death of the Soul, are real Execution served from God's Bar; 'tis the Conscience, which always does suppose Condemnation. For every Execution legally served, does necessarily follow Condemnation going before. 2. This Execution is served on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for the Sin of Unbelief, or for rejecting Gospel Grace more eminently (to wit) Security, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Heart, blindness of Mind, brawniness of Conscience. See <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.7,8,9,10. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.14. and the other Evangelists, <hi>John</hi> 12.40. <hi>Acts</hi> 28.26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8. And this must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily suppose a Law Condemnation there for that very Sin, even for refusing to believe what the God of Truth declares in the Gospel. So I conclude, the Elect Sinner may be under Condemnation in his Conscience, and in reference to his State, when he is not under Condemnation in the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en. So that, that Condemnation mentioned, <hi>John</hi> 3.18. if took in the two latter Sense, may mean the Elect the Sinner: But if Condemnation there be understood simply and analogously it cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd the Elect Sinner at all; unless we vacate God's Will, and the Death of his Son. So I conclude, 'tis not true, that the Principle as held by us, is contrary to the express Word of God. But</p>

            <p>His Eighth Argument is, That 'tis a Contradion to affirm, <hi>A Man to be actually Dead, and</hi> (he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>I have told him, there is no Contradictions in Assertions; unless all the Conditions of Opposition be punctually there. If there be a failure in one, there is not a lawful Opposition: As for Instance, A Man may be said actually Alive, and actually Dead at one and the same time; but yet in divers Parts and Manner. He may be said to actually Alive in his Body; but spiritually Dead in his Soul. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctually Alive as to bodily Life, but actually Dead as to spiritual Life. So a Tree may be said to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e actually Dead in the Branches, but actually Alive in the Root. And thus a Man may be said at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e Pardon comes down, and sets him <hi>rectus in eâ Curia:</hi> i. e. Discharged at the Bar. And no less
<pb facs="tcp:42485:23"/> may an Elect Sinner be said at one and the same time, to be actually condemned as in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> in respect of the Covenant he is under, and at the Bar of God in his Conscience also. And yet actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally justified by Virtue of that secret Relation he has to the second <hi>Adam,</hi> as a Surety and Root, and that actual Justification he has in him; which his Surety has received for him; which he has a <hi>Right</hi> to in him; though not a Possession of in his Conscience. And this involves no Contradiction at all, as has been afore manifested. And therefore I need not add, but only this. That such seeming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions are in a Believer. He may be actually Condemned by sensible Guilt in his Conscience. And yet the <hi>Prefacer</hi> will grant him to be then actually justified at the same time at God's Bar above. The Truths Faith receives, are a Mystery and seeming Contradiction to the Flesh. <hi>I am Black, but Comely,</hi> is a Contradiction to Flesh and Blood: But Faith reconciles it, Black in my self, but Comely in the comeliness of my Head. Thus again, <hi>When I am weak, then am I strong,</hi> says Faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.10. This may appear Non-sense to the Wisdom of the Flesh: But Faith can make good Sense of it, and unfold it thus. When I am most emptied of my self, and see my inward spiritual weakness most; then do I go forth to Act most in the fulness of Christ, and in that <hi>Strength in him above can do all things.</hi> So this Language of Faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. — <hi>Having nothing, and yet possessi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g all things,</hi> seems very absurd to Carnal Reason. But yet 'tis the Truth Faith feeds on; when it sees it has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it's spiritual Sense; but that, that is quite starved: And yet, then it possesses all things by Faith in Christ the blessed Root and Head above. The things of Faith are Misterious, and above proud Reason. Therefore, if this <hi>Prefacer</hi> and others, bring down the Truths of Jesus, the peculiar Objects of Faith to the Bar of Carnal Reason, and the Wisdom of the Flesh. We the Ministers of Jesus, in the Name of our Lord and King enter a Caveat there, and protest against the Jurisdiction of the Wisdom of the Flesh, over the sublime Misteries of the Gospel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19,20,21.</p>
            <p>His Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Arguments are but one and the same; therefore I shall put them all into one, and cast them into this Form for him.</p>
            <p>Actual Justification has inseparably annexed to it, as Concomitants, and immediate Consequents, Change of Heart, Effectual Calling, Sanctification and Holy Communion with God.</p>
            <p>But in a State of Nature and afore Faith, there is none of these in the Soul. <hi>Ergo,</hi> none actually Justified, till he does Believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer,</hi> This Syllogism lies liable to many Attacks: But I shall content my self to distinguish upon his Propo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ition. There is a twofold actual Justification, as has been already proved. The one, the Elect Sinner has in Christ, ever since Christ received an actual Justification for him in his Room and St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad, as his Surety and Representative. 2. There is an actual Justification brought down into the Conscience, and received by Faith. The former belongs to the Sinner; whilst in a natural State, nay before he has a being. The la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter only, is the Sinner's by Faith. And 'tis to the latter, that those Blessings of Renovation, Sanctification and Communion are inseparably conjoyned. So that his Proposition is false, without the aforesaid Limitation: And understood with it, he does but beg the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and Disputes against that, which is not denied him.</p>
            <p>His Thirteenth Argument is against Union afore Faith. And it runs thus. <hi>Ʋnion afore Faith sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses there may be Ʋnion between two Parties; when but one Consents; which he says is an Absurdity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Answer, this again is begging the Question. For we do not affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m that, that Union, which is founded on Consent of Parties, (as the Marriage-Union consummated between Christ and the Soul) is afore Faith, but grant 'tis formed up by Faith. But will he deny all manner of Union to be afore Faith? No, he grants Unition (which is Union on Christ's part, and that real too; to be afore the Consent of the Soul, and therefore he himself has answered his own Argument. I do also hope, he will grant this, that all Mankind were united to <hi>Adam;</hi> when he was yet alone, as their Root and Representative; before ever any of them had a being to ask their Consents; and that this Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was so really; that they are really affected with what befel him, and that by Virtue of Union. They sinned in his Sin, we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e condemned in his Condemnation; and in Sense executed in his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. to the end. And who dare say, they were not really on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with him? After the same manner, the Elect number were united to Christ, when he took their Natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> upon him, as a Surety, Head, Root, and Rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esentative. And the Union between him and them, was so real; that they again were really Arraigned, Condemned, Sentenced, and in a Sence Executed in him; when that Threat of the Law was verified on them individually, as considered in their Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Answer,</hi> I am amazed at such Logick. 'Tis enough for me to say here. I deny his Consequence and desire him to prove it. For my Part, I cannot see how this argues a shadow of Consequence with it, as some of the rest do. But he might as well have inferred thus. If this Doctrine of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification and Union afore Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

I would have him seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously consider, that his way of arguing is like the <hi>Papists</hi> of Old, arguing against the Reformation. Because amongst the Reformers that left them, there were <hi>Sociania<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> that denied the Godhead of Christ; and some, that denied the Law to be a Rule of Holy Walk; and <hi>Anti-paedo-baptists,</hi> that held strange Principles, and had stranger Practises; that therefore the Doctrine of Free Justification, and that concerning their Mass and Images being Idolatry, were Licentious, and Erronious Doctrines. And does he think in his Conscience they did do well? There is no end of accusing Principles, from the falls and mistakes of some, that profess it. All Parties have done it, and it has still returned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pon themselves? But to what he has done of that kind, I have answered already.</p>
            <p>His Last is, That <hi>this tends to lead People to venture on Christ presumptuously; and conclude, they are J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e same Answer shall suffice. And the <hi>Reader</hi> must pardon me, if I have gone over again and again <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he same Answer's as to Substance; for he necessitated me thereunto, when he had cast but the same Topick into divers Shapes and Phrases.</p>
            <p>From his Arguments, I pass to his Authorities. And the first he brings is the D termination of the Messengers and Pastors of 106 Churches in this Point of Doctrine; where they give it against Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication afore Faith. Whereupon I Remark.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That though I have a great Deference for the Judgment of so many Churches; yet Humane Authority has not footing firm enough for my Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was not the Churches, but their Messengers of their own Head determined the Point. And they indeed carried the Question to their respective Churches, and thereupon a solemn Debate after Prayer, each particular Church had come to such a Resolution, it then might have passed for the Judgment of the Churches. But I understand no such warranty from Christ Churches, have to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>te Messengers to determine Matters of Faith for them; nor what rule they have to depute their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, the Determination of those Servants of Christ, met at their Assembly at <hi>London,</hi> is no more than their own Particular Judgments: And no further to be received, than it has God's Word for it's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>arranty. And no more is the Judgment of any Man, or number of Men in the World.</p>
            <p>What he quotes out of other Learned and Godly Men, makes nothing to his Purpose; f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

            <p>His Question proposed, and by him answered. I grant true, as to the main; but Clinches not as to the present Controversie, for still it runs on a mistake of the Question. And seems to be brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 word">
